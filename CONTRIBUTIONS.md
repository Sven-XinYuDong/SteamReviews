## Expected Workflow

After initial discussions, we have decided that our project will focus on building two implementations: 1) Reviews analysis (e.g. aggregating text from reviews), 2) Profile summaries, in which users are able to compare their gaming preferences to their friend groups.

We have decided that Xinyu will be responsible for building implementation one (review analysis), and Matthew will be responsible for building implementation two (dashboard).

Each group member will work independently on their own assigned implementations. This includes building a functional implementation (e.g. collecting, wrangling, visualizing data). In addition, each group member will also independently build the supporting structure (e.g. error handling, unit tests, documentation) around their own implementations.

Apart from that, group members will meet when there is a need to (e.g. deciding or changing project directions, feedback on implementations or help needed, preparing for the presentation).
