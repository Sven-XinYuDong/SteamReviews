\"language\": \"english\", \"review\": \" b red dead redemption    b  is by far the best game of all time  it s one of the biggest  most elaborate  most impressive games ever made  it s hard not to agree that this is a masterpiece in the gaming industry  but not for everyone  obviously     h  story  h   the story of the protagonist at the beginning seems simple enough  a bad man  in a gang that is engaged in robberies  sometimes murders  the player can line up arthur in a slightly different way  you can become a better person  do good deeds and get on the right path  in the middle of the game  arthur learns about the disease  which will make him repent of what he is doing and why he is doing it  the plot is told slowly  but it is exciting  interesting  thoughtful  i want to go through each mission  watch cutscenes and see what will happen next with the main character and his gang  after all  the gang is also changing and not for the best  but see for yourself   additional tasks are inferior to the plot in interestingness  some tasks act as teaching something  for example  how to rob a cart  to whom to drive it to get a reward  there are many short tasks  funny and even scary  some of the quests are connected with the heroes from dutch s gang  you can once again take a break from the storyline or learn something new and interesting  almost all tasks are quite simple  so why not go through them  next  we will talk about gaming activities and the liveliness of the world  there are a lot of them in the game  you will hardly find a more filled world than in red dead redemption    random encounters happen everywhere  whether to help people depends only on you  unexpected attacks of hostile gangs on you  of which there are only   in the game  and all over the world you can meet people from different gangs or their camps  many small tasks  random encounters  as well as the opportunity to explore the world   cigarette cards of which there are more than a hundred in the game and each card belongs to a separate collection  they can be collected and sold to a collector    dinosaur bones  there are    bones in the game  after you collect all  an additional quest will open    hunting and fishing  a total of    legendary fish and    legendary animals that require bait to catch   dreamcatchers     locations in total  they are one of the types of collectibles that hang from trees    treasure maps  caches  cave paintings  board games and much more you can find just by exploring the world  whether you do this or not is up to you    h  gameplay  h    the gameplay is very meditative  slow  but at the same time exciting and quite interesting  the game has excellent movement on a horse around the big world  excellent battles with enemy gangs  there is a hunting and fishing system  a resource management system    h  sound design and graphics  h    the game has a gorgeous picture  there is no doubt about it  i really liked the play of the rays of the sun  well done change of weather  time of day  rain   thunderstorm is generally a separate topic for admiration  in a word  not a game  but a real paradise for those who like to take beautiful screenshots  the music score also fits in very well with the game  one can feel the attention to every little thing  in the same collection of herbs  bottles  cans  opening cabinets  doors  and so on  even the process of collecting trophies from opponents  of course  the speed of collecting items suffered from this  and for many  i think  for the entire time of the game  all this will have time to get bored with order  moreover  the animations of all this are the same the horse riding is also excellent  as is the care of the filly   it s so good that i ve never used fast travel during my entire playthrough  what for    if there is so much to see around  and in general  it allowed me to fully feel the atmosphere of the game      h  conclusion  h    this is one of the best story games  if you want to get a great story for     hours and delve into the world of the wild west  you should definitely try this game if you haven t already  the game has a lot of cool activities  various secrets  very serious detailing and elaboration of small details that no one ever thinks about  but they are in the game  i want to erase my memory in order to go through this game again and get a lot of fun and enjoyment  i definitely recommend at least trying this game  even if it s not your genre    h  final score            h  \", \"timestamp_created\": 1672214756, \"timestamp_updated\": 1672214756,

to say that red dead redemption   isn t just a game  it s an experience    i m a huge fan of open world games and this is easily the best open world i ve experienced  it may not be the largest or have the most activities  but it s a joy to spend time in  it s probably the most visually impressive game i ve ever played  from the general beauty and atmosphere to fine details like footprints in mud and bullet holes in hats   those impressive visuals need a powerful pc to experience though  with an i       k and      i ended up using graphics analysis videos on youtube to configure everything to get a mostly stable    hz at     p  i have screenshots of the settings i used in my collection that may be of help   i m posting this after a single playthrough of the story mode  i didn t rush through the game but i also deliberately didn t see everything  to save plenty of side content for another time   the story hooked me in the first hour and never let go  the general pace is excellent  the characters are interesting with fantastic voice acting and the missions were varied and interesting from beginning to end  the soundtrack and general ambience are stunning  i repeatedly found myself strolling through populated areas  finding somewhere to sit and watching the world go by  listening to conversations between people that could easily have been missed  i haven t done that since my first playthrough of skyrim  the world really feels alive   red dead redemption   is easily one of the best games i ve ever played  and in my humble opinion it s one of the greatest games ever made  i could say a lot more about the game  but i don t want to spoil any aspect of it for anyone  i went in blind and i m very glad i did   it certainly isn t perfect though  the compulsory rockstar launcher sometimes decides i don t own the game  requiring a restart of just the launcher or the whole pc  i ve also experienced a few crashes when trying to load the game from the main menu  though i didn t experience a single crash once i was actually in  i experienced a few graphical glitches  like shadows not appearing or shadows not disappearing when they should  a bit of light flickering  some artifacts when very close to particle clouds and parts of the main characters face not loading  but nothing major  most were solved be reloading the last save   i did find the controls a little awkward at times  i started the game using mouse   keyboard  where i found armed combat very easy but melee combat and general movement was clumsy  after a few hours i tried a controller and found everything except armed combat much better  the free aim was too slow with controller  but enabling aim assist helped without doing all the work for me so i d personally recommend playing with a controller   i was hesitant to get this at first  as i ve never really been a fan of stories in this setting  i never played the first game and i found gtav disappointing overall  but from the opening cutscene to the end credits  red dead redemption   is enthralling  spectacular and magnificent  i very highly recommend it to anyone interested in story based games  it s an experience i certainly won
