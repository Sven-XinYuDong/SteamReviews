-	Researched about how to use Steam API’s
-	Explored the different data that Steam store offers…
-	Brainstormed ideas about what to do for project proposal  and discussed with partner
-	Got the initial (messy) code for extracting reviews ready

1/29/2023
-	Increased number of ideas for implementation 1: Google Docs here
-	Increased number of data we can work with such as scraping from https://steampricehistory.com
-	Organized web API’s from week 1 into a neatly organized file
-	Started to work on implementation one data

2/04/2023
-	Finished extraction functions for all relevant data in implementation one
-	Created implementation one chart, which is a bar chart with dropdown interactive features
-	Created data transformation functions to allow for interactive bar charts to be plotted
-	Built prototype ideas to incorporate a dashboard in addition to bar chart that we have (ideas include incorporating a word cloud of games that appears as highlight bar chart, etc), discussed this with partner

-	Tried to build prototype idea to incorporate word cloud of games that appears as highlight gaming bar chart on the left, which did not work out
-	Built the current prototype dashboard. Which is a simplified, yet messy form of another bar chart plotting count of games as you highlight games on the left. 
-	Tried to add another chart to the dashboard that plots the genres of games; this required scraping genres (using a function built earlier, around 1/29) and extra data structure transform processes. Though it was implementable, caused inaccuracies in middle plot (bar plot of counts) and therefore decided to stick to dashboard of two charts to save time.
-	Added unit tests for 1/3 of my functions and test suite.
-	Configured .yml files in Travis

2/06/2023
-	Built presentation slides with partner, practised presentation.

2/09/2023
-	Finished documentation for Steam Functions
-	Finished unit tests for all functions.
-	Finished vignette.
-	Organized the structure of repository (e.g. adding folders, subfolders)
